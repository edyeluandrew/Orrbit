## The Problem

### Subscription Economy is Broken

**For Consumers:**
- 💸 Hidden fees (3-5% payment processing)
- 🌍 Limited global access (banking required)
- 🔒 No control over recurring charges
- ❌ Difficult cancellation processes

**For Service Providers:**
- 📉 High payment processing fees (2.9% + $0.30)
- ⏰ Long settlement times (2-7 days)
- 🚫 Chargebacks and fraud losses
- 🌐 Difficulty accepting international payments

### Market Reality

> **2.5 billion adults globally remain unbanked** but increasingly have smartphone access.

> **$275 billion** subscription economy by 2028, growing 12% annually.
